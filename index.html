                    <p>Welcome to the Code Quiz! Once you click the begin button the game can begin. In the top right corner there is a timer that will begin from 60 and count down. You will be presented with a question and a set of 4 answers, it is up to you to select the correct answer. If you choose the wrong answer then the timer will lose 10 seconds, if you choose correctly nothing happens to the timer. Once you finish answering all the questions then the end timer score is your final score and you can submit that to the high scores page. Click on the "View High Scores" button in the top left to view the high scores for the game. Good Luck!</p>
